My name is Chen Asraf and I'm a Full Stack Developer. I love technology,
I'm a programmer at heart; and I will ramble sometimes about all of them in this blog.

You can see some of my projects on my GitHub page, linked at the bottom.
I like playing around with Flutter, I'm a master at JS and React, and sometimes play around with Ruby and Python.
