My name is Chen Asraf and I'm a Full Stack Developer. I love technology,
I'm a programmer at heart; and I will ramble sometimes about all of them in this blog.

You can see some of my projects on the [Projects](/projects) page or on my [GitHub](https://github.com/chenasraf) page.

I like playing around with Flutter and Dart, I'm a master at JS/TS and React, and sometimes play around with Ruby and Python.
